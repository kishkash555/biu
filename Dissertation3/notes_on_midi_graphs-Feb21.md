### 1001

- interaction - participant 1 misses beat, especially in the last, fastest-paced part
- freestyle - variable, good phase, **participant 1 and 3 have unexpected and unaccompanied peaks**. participants 2 and 3 seem especially well coupled between 43 and 62, and throughout

---

### 1003

- interaction (condition 1) - chaos - high frequency, apparently unsynced
- freestyle **very little apparent sync**

---

### 1004

- interaction (condition 0) - participant* 2 drumming slower, but (in last part) in passing sync with participant 1
- freestyle - **very good sync between 2 and 3 from 168 onward**. participant 1 looks like doing his own thing

---

### 1005

- (condition 1) **very good coordination** especially in 3rd and 4th parts (4th part has correlation not complete match)

- fs: fair coordination of participants 2 and 3

---

### 1006

- interaction: fairly disciplined, but not very coordinated.
- **fs: period of 2pi/3 shifted oscillations. participant 2 seems to be the driver of the more-and-more oscilliatory behavior.**
**Looks like rms synchrony would be interesting here**

---

### 1007

- **interaction: excellent synch of participant 1 and 3**
- good sync with participant 2
- fs: a few periods of correlation between 1 and 3. far less with participant 2

---

### 1008

- interaction: ample examples of correlation among all three throughout
- freestyle: perfect match

---

### 1009

- unsynchronized start and stop
- participant 3 tends to spike upwards
- fs: some examples of good engagement between 1 and 2, much less between 1 and 3, some between 2 and 3

---

### 1010

- sync in start and stop and in last part (esp. 1 and 3)
- fs: good engagement between 1 and 2
- 3 engages, but at a longer time scale

---

### 1011

- intearction: participant 1 seems like he got bored and started improvising. he managed to carry participant 3 with him and later participant 2
- fs: participants 1-3: good squared fit. goot to fair phase fit. some momentum issues. same with participant 2

---

### 1012 

- interaction: participants are not synchronized, but seem to be having fun :). start and stop sync fairly good. 
- freestyle: very nice example of one participant leading the pack - participant 2.

---

### 1013

- poor coordination

---

### 1014

- interaction: good coordination, especially participant 1 and 2
- fs: looks like participant 2 usually takes the lead; in other cases, he/she quickly responds to changes initiated by other participants

---

### 1015

- interaction: participant 2 consistently drums at half speed. participants 1 and 3 reached synchrony a few seconds towrads the end
- fs: very nice case of alternating leadership

---

### 1016

- interaction: uncoordinated jitter
- freestyle: rough coordination of participants 1 and 3. with participant 2, phase and scale shift are evident, as well as periods of unanswered shifts

---

### 1017

- interaction: participant 1 not keeping the pace in first parts. participant 2 stops mid-part, carrying the others with him, then resumes
- freesetyle: unusually long periods of constant drumming from participant 1. many delays, ratio and noise in the synch of 2 and 3

---

### 1018

- interaction: some nice coordination in the first part (cond. 1)
- very poor coordination (although 1 and 2 somewhat are)
